Provide a fallback so that Django can use PyMySQL when the
`MySQLdb` C extension (mysqlclient) is not available on the host.

This is a safe, best-effort fallback: if PyMySQL is installed it will
be registered as the MySQLdb interface. If neither is available the
ImportError will be left to Django when it tries to load the DB backend.
